# Innovation-s
I am fond of doing optimization in all projects I am working, Most likely I would thrive to innovate something new which reduces the user intervention periodically.
Nevertheless, I am an expert in mainframe technologies. I'm a beginner in Python programming, Django webdev. For data visualzation I like D3.JS, Tableau & Excel. I am much fascinated about Natrual language processing , Maching learning and Artificial Intelligence.
